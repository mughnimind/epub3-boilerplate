<h2>We've got a witch</h2>

<p>Who is zis? It is King Arthur, and these are the Knights of the Round Table. Who's castle is this? This is the castle of Our Master Ruiz' de lu la Ramper. Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest. If he will give us food and shelter for the night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail. Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen... Uh, he's already got one, you see?</p>

<blockquote><small>Arthur and his men search the land for clues to the Grail. They come to a castle occupied by rude French soldiers who claim to have the Grail and insult the Englishmen. Arthur and his men come up with a plan to sneak in using a <i id="trojan">Trojan Rabbit</i>, but they mishandle its execution when they forget to hide inside it and are forced away. Arthur decides that the knights should go their separate ways to search for clues to the Grail's whereabouts.</small></blockquote>

<p>Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur. The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise, and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required if the quest for the <em>Holy Grail</em> were to be brought to a successful conclusion. Arthur, having consulted his closest knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually. Now, this is what they did.</p>

<h3>The Tale of Sir Galahad</h3>

<p>I seek the Grail! I have seen it, here in this castle! No! Oh, no! Bad, bad Zoot! What is it? Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot! She has been setting alight to our beacon, which, I just remembered, is grail-shaped. It's not the first time we've had this problem. It's not the real Grail? Oh, wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot! Oh, she is a naughty person, and she must pay the penalty, and here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment for setting alight the grail-shaped beacon. You must tie her down on a bed and spank her!</p>

<blockquote><small>On the knights' travels, Arthur and Bedevere attempt to satisfy the strange requests of the dreaded Knights Who Say Ni. Sir Robin avoids a fight with a Three-Headed Giant by running away while the heads are arguing. Sir Galahad is led by a grail-shaped beacon to Castle Anthrax, populated by 150 nubile young women, but to his chagrin is "rescued" by Lancelot. Lancelot, after finding a note from Swamp Castle believed to be from a lady being forced to marry against her will, rushes to the castle and kills nearly the entire wedding party, only to discover that the note was sent by an effeminate prince.</small></blockquote>

<p>Sir Galahad! You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality. Oh, I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours. We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes, all between sixteen and nineteen and a half, cut off in this castle with no one to protect us! Oh, it is a lonely life; bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear...  We are just not used to handsome knights. Nay, nay, come, come, you may lie here. Oh, but you are wounded! No, no, i-it's nothing! Oh, but you must see the doctors immediately! No, no, please, lie down. Ah. What seems to be the trouble? They're doctors?! Uh, they've had a basic medical training, yes.</p>

<p>Sir Launcelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation, but they were still no nearer the Grail. Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedemir, not more than a swallow's flight away, had discovered something. Oh, that's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously. I mean, they were more than two laden swallow's flights away, four, really, if they hadn't a cord of line between them. I mean, if the birds were walking and dragging.</p>
