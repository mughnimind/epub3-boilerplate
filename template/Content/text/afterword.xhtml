    <h2 class="mt-1">Afterword</h2>
    <p>Originally the knight characters were going to ride <em>real</em> horses, but after it became clear that the film's small budget precluded real horses (except for a lone horse appearing in a couple of scenes), the Pythons decided that their characters would <em>mime</em> horse-riding while their porters trotted behind them banging <strong>coconut</strong> shells together. The joke was derived from the old-fashioned sound effect used by radio shows to convey the sound of hooves clattering.</p>
